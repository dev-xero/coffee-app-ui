    <string name="cappuccino_description">
        Cappuccino is a popular coffee beverage that originated in Italy. It consists of equal
        parts of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam.\n
        The drink is typically served in a small cup, and the espresso is first brewed and poured
        into the cup. Then, the steamed milk is added, followed by a layer of milk foam on top.
        The foam is often decorated with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon.\n
        Cappuccinos are known for their rich, creamy texture and bold coffee flavor.
        They are often enjoyed as a breakfast or mid-morning drink, but can be enjoyed anytime throughout
        the day.\n
        Cappuccinos can be made with a variety of milk types, such as whole, skim, or soy milk, and can
        also be flavored with syrups or spices for added sweetness or flavor.
